Conversion of IPCC documents into semantic form


## goals

* to convert the IPCC documents from PDF into (a) HTML (b) XML
* extract terms and exploire their use and meaning
* link terms to Wikidata and create AMI-dictionaries
* create new structiures for navigation, search, display

# Content

Initially we will start with AR6 WGIII but move onto other WG's and perhaps look backwards as well.

## Strategy

Create a directory ("CProject") with all current PDFs (Chapters, etc.)
